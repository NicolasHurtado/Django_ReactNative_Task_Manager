# Collaborative Task Management System

A complete task management system with client-server architecture, built with React Native (frontend) and Django (backend).



## üìã Project Structure

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for backend)
- Bash (to run the startup script)


This repository contains two main components:

### 1. Frontend (task_manager/)

A mobile application developed with React Native and Expo for collaborative task management:

- **Key Features**: User authentication, task management, task assignment, deadlines, overlap detection
- **Technologies**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, React Navigation, Formik and Yup
- **Interface**: Modern and intuitive with modals for a smooth experience

[View detailed frontend documentation](./task_manager/README.md)

### 2. Backend (backend/)

A RESTful API built with Django and Django Rest Framework:

- **Key Features**: JWT Authentication, user management, task CRUD operations, data validation
- **Technologies**: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Security**: Token-based authentication, protected endpoints, data validation

[View detailed backend documentation](./backend/README.md)



## üîÑ Communication Flow

The frontend (React Native) communicates with the backend (Django) through a REST API:

1. **Authentication**: User logs in and backend generates a JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Requests to the backend include the token to access protected resources
3. **CRUD Operations**: Frontend can create, read, update, and delete tasks through specific endpoints
4. **Validation**: Backend validates data and returns appropriate responses (success/error)

## üöÄ Quick Start

To start both backend and frontend at once, use the provided script:

- **IMPORTANT**: You must change the `API_URL` variable in the frontend `.env` file  with your ip:
    ```bash
        API_URL=http://192.168.x.x:8000/api
    ```

```bash
bash start_app.sh
```

This will:
1. Start the backend services with Docker Compose
2. Install frontend dependencies
3. Start the Expo development server for the frontend

## üì¶ Deployment

### Backend

- **Production**: Can be deployed on services like AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.
- **Docker**: Includes Docker configuration ready for production
- **Database**: Configured to use PostgreSQL

### Frontend

- **Expo**: Can be built for iOS and Android using Expo
- **Standalone**: APKs/IPAs can be generated for distribution
- **Environment Variables**: Configurable for different environments (development/production)
